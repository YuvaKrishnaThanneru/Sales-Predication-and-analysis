## Overview ðŸŒŸ

This project aims to predict the sales of various products of the Adidas Company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for analysis and prediction is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of approximately 9652 records.


## Dataset Information

The dataset contains information such as product details, sales methods, region-wise sales, operating profit, and more. It provides a comprehensive view of sales-related data for analysis and prediction.

**Dataset Source:** [Adidas Sales Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset/data)

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset's characteristics, including descriptive statistics, visualizations of sales trends, top-selling products, retailers, and methods.
  
- **Machine Learning:** A multiple linear regression model is built to predict total sales based on various features such as region, product, sales method, units sold, price per unit, and operating profit.

## Usage 

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
   - Place the dataset file (`adidas_sales_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).
   - Run the `sales_prediction_notebook.ipynb` script or notebook to perform data analysis and train the machine learning model.

3. **Results:**
   - The script generates visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots) to explore sales trends and correlations.
   - The machine learning model predicts total sales and evaluates performance using R-squared value.
